\section{Local Optimizations}

Local Optimizations never goes away because this is always a piece of what happens even when we 
talk about even more sophiscated types of optimizations.

First we will talk about how to represent the code within a function or procedure, that's using 
something called a flow graph which is made of basic blocks.  Next we will contrast two different 
abstractions for doing local optimizations.
